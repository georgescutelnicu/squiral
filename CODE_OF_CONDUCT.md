# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, regardless of background, disability, ethnicity, and identity.

Code is not the only way to help the project. Answering questions to help others issues, reviewing pull requests, organizing and teaching tutorials, improving the documentation, are all priceless contributions.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and inclusive of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.
- Being patient and understanding in discussions and collaborations.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Public or private harassment or discrimination of any kind.
- Offensive comments or actions, including personal attacks.
- Any form of trolling, insulting, or derogatory language or behavior.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

If you encounter behavior that violates this code of conduct, please contact SADIK KUZU at [sadikkuzu@hotmail.com]. All reports will be kept confidential.

Thank you for contributing to a positive and inclusive community!
